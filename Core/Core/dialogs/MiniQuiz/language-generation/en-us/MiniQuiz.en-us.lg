- Contraventions of the prohibitions against sexual harassment under the SDO would lead to civil liability. Certain acts of sexual harassment, such as touching another person‚Äôs private parts without his/her consent, may also amount to the offence of indecent assault under the Crimes Ordinance.

# SendActivity_B4M5X3_text()
- While the claimant of a sexual harassment claim has the burden of proof to support his/her claim with reasons and evidence in legal proceedings, such claims are civil in nature, meaning that the standard of proof adopted by the Court would not be ‚Äúbeyond reasonable doubt‚Äù as in criminal cases, but ‚Äúon the balance of probabilities‚Äù. In adopting this standard of proof, the Court would evaluate the evidence presented by both the claimant and the respondent before determining whose account is more credible, and whether to accept the issues raised by the claimant and his/her claim. The standard of proof is therefore considerably lower than that in criminal proceedings.

The law provides for a defence for the employer or person engaging the intern or volunteer, where they can prove that they have taken ‚Äúreasonably practicable steps‚Äù to prevent the employee, intern or volunteer from doing the relevant sexual harassment act (note: there is no equivalent defence for principals).
Such steps may include formulating a comprehensive anti\-sexual harassment policy, informing all workplace participants of the policy through different channels, providing training and reviewing the policy on a periodic basis, as well as setting up a complaint\-handling mechanism and designating staff to handle complaints. Ultimately, in the event of a civil claim, the Court will consider the specifc circumstances of the case and decide whether the steps taken are suffcient. "```
